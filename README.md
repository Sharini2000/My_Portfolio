README - My Portfolio

This technical README provides an overview and explanation of the code structure and functionality implemented in my portfolio.


## Introduction

My Portfolio is a personal website designed to showcase my skills, projects, certifications, and contact information. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with additional libraries for specific functionalities.

## File Structure

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the portfolio.
- stylesheet.css: The CSS file responsible for styling the portfolio layout and components.
- main.js: The JavaScript file handling dynamic behavior such as button clicks and modal functionality.
- Images/: Directory containing images used in the portfolio.
- README.md: The README file providing an overview of the portfolio.

## Code Explanation

### HTML

The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the portfolio. It consists of sections such as Home, About, Skills, Certifications, Projects, and Contact. Each section is structured using semantic HTML elements like `<section>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<div>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`. Buttons and forms are used for user interaction and data submission.

### CSS

The CSS file (`stylesheet.css`) provides the styling for the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout. It includes styles for fonts, colors, spacing, positioning, animations, and responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file (`main.js`) contains the logic for interactive features and dynamic behavior within the portfolio. It utilizes the `document.addEventListener()` method to handle the DOMContentLoaded event and execute functions when the HTML document is fully loaded. The JavaScript code handles typing effect for text elements, modal functionality for displaying certification and project images, and form submission for contact messages.

## Dependencies

The portfolio relies on the following dependencies:
- Typed.js: Used for the typing effect in text elements.

## Hosting

The portfolio is hosted using GitHub Pages, which allows for easy deployment of static websites directly from GitHub repositories.
